# Coronavirus Tracker

In these unprecedented and testing times, taking health precautions is utmost important. ALong with staying cautious, what is more important is having knowledge about what is going on around the world. With that being said, I created a real-time coronavirus tracker web application that informs the user with the number of new covid cases a day and a break-down by countries/state. I was able to make use of SpringBoot and a coronavirus data spreadsheet (constantly updated) to make this.
